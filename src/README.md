# Speed run timer

## What is this?
This is a split timer for video game speedruns, specifically for .

## Tell me more.
This application is written in JavaScript and currently runs in a web browser. I will be integrating it with Electron and distributing desktop packages for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.

**[You can watch me develop this application live on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/s__herzog).**

## Why?
1. I can't run LiveSplit on Linux.
2. Existing speedrun timers still don't have all the features that some streamers want.
3. I needed a project to show on my stream that is interesting to work on, relevant to my friends, and actually useful.

## Project status
The basic timer code is functional, as well as the interface for creating, saving, and loading run settings.

## Feature requests
I'm writing this app to meet the needs of speedrun streamers, so if there's something you want out of a timer, I want to hear it. Please post feature requests as GitHub issues or contact me directly on GitHub or Twitch (@s__herzog) and I will add issues on your behalf.

## Code contributions
